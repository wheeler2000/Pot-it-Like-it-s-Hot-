## I get it!

College life is hard- I get it! My freshman year of college, there was absolutely nothing green about my thumbs... at all. I had classes, clubs, intramural sports, and zero time to take care of anything but myself (mind you, it was a struggle.) But I loved having plants around whether to brighten up the room, clean the air, or to just simply look at. I locked myself to my chair and began researching easier plants to take care of.

You want to dress up your room with a little greenery, but dont have time or patience for constant care? Here is a list of some easy-care plants that wont break the bank and will thrive in a dorm environment!

### SUCC it Up, Buttercup!

Succulents are the EASIEST plants to have. Leave them on your windowsill and water them about once a week, and you're good!  

### Fine Like Vines

Golden pathos are extremely resilient, even when forgotten about for a bit. They do not require much sunlight and vine out like crazy. Also, they are very easy to propogate. This can save you money in the long run! This is very true for all philodendrons.

### Peace Lily

Peace Lily's are great for air purifying and are so pretty to look at! It does well in low light and low humidity, so it doesnt have to be right in the window. This opens up a range of places you can put it in your dorm!

### Snake Plant

Snake plants are strong, tall leaved plants also known as the mother-in-law's tongue. They do well in normal room temperature and can survive in a wide range of sunlight exposure. Be careful of overwatering this guy! If the top few inches of the soil is dry, water it. Otherwise, leave it alone.

### Rubber Tree

Rubber trees may not look very mighty at first, but do not be fooled. These guys can grow up to 8-feet tall! That means that once you move out of your dorm, you can have a bigger pop of color to dress up a room. They like medium to bright light exposure and need their soil to be completely dry before watering again. Plus, they have a shiny finish look on their leaves!

### TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND

1. Give yourself some grace!
-Taking care of plants is a learning process. It's okay to fail, but it's more important to keep trying! No one is perfect!
2. Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to water your plants.
-Life gets chaotic, especially nowadays, so set a little reminder!
3. Buy the Right Pot! Size Matters!
-When you purchase a pot for your plant, make sure it is bigger in diameter by at least a few inches. Leave room for the little guy to grow.
4. The internet is your Friend!
-If you ever get confused, research! There are so many resources to help you out. 
5. Picture This!
-Picture This is an app that allows you to take a picture of any plant and tells you all about it and how to take care of them! It's free on all devices!
6. Pick Up Limes
