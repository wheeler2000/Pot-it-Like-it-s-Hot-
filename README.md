## I get it!

College life is hard- I get it! My freshman year of college, there was absolutely nothing green about my thumbs... at all. I had classes, clubs, intramural sports, and zero time to take care of anything but myself (mind you, it was a struggle.) But I loved having plants around whether to brighten up the room, clean the air, or to just simply look at. I locked myself to my chair and began researching easier plants to take care of.

You want to dress up your room with a little greenery, but dont have time or patience for constant care? Here is a list of some easy-care plants that wont break the bank and will thrive in a dorm environment!

### SUCC it Up, Buttercup!

Succulents are the EASIEST plants to have. Leave them on your windowsill and water them about once a week, and you're good!

## TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND

1. _Give yourself some grace!_
Taking care of plants is a learning process. It's okay to fail, but it's more important to keep trying! No one is perfect!
2. _Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to water your plants._
Life gets chaotic, especially nowadays, so set a little reminder!
3. _Buy the Right Pot! Size Matters!_
When you purchase a pot for your plant, make sure it is bigger in diameter by at least a few inches. Leave room for the little guy to grow.
4. _The internet is your Friend!_
If you ever get confused, research! There are so many resources to help you out. 
5. _Picture This!_
Picture This is an app that allows you to take a picture of any plant and tells you all about it and how to take care of them! It's free on all devices!
6. _Pick Up Limes_
If you want to watch a video on the beginnings of plant care, here is the link to one of my favorite vegan minimalist youtubers, Sadia. She is super knowledgable, experienced, and overall a great online mentor. Check her out!
