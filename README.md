## I get it!

College life is hard- I get it! My freshman year of college, there was absolutely nothing green about my thumbs... at all. I had classes, clubs, intramural sports, and zero time to take care of anything but myself (mind you, it was a struggle.) But I loved having plants around whether to brighten up the room, clean the air, or to just simply look at. I locked myself to my chair and began researching easier plants to take care of.

You want to dress up your room with a little greenery, but dont have time or patience for constant care? Here is a list of some easy-care plants that wont break the bank and will thrive in a dorm environment!

### SUCC it Up, Buttercup!

Succulents are the EASIEST plants to have. Leave them on your windowsill and water them about once a week, and you're good!  

### Fine Like Vines

Golden pathos are extremely resilient, even when forgotten about for a bit. They do not require much sunlight and vine out like crazy. Also, they are very easy to propogate. This can save you money in the long run! This is very true for all philodendrons.

### Peace Lily

Peace Lily's are great for air purifying and are so pretty to look at! It does well in low light and low humidity, so it doesnt have to be right in the window. This opens up a range of places you can put it in your dorm!

### Snake Plant

Snake plants are strong, tall leaved plants also known as the mother-in-law's tongue. They do well in normal room temperature and can survive in a wide range of sunlight exposure. Be careful of overwatering this guy! If the top few inches of the soil is dry, water it. Otherwise, leave it alone.

### Rubber Tree

Rubber trees may not look very mighty at first, but do not be fooled. These guys can grow up to 8-feet tall! That means that once you move out of your dorm, you can have a bigger pop of color to dress up a room. They like medium to bright light exposure and need their soil to be completely dry before watering again. Plus, they have a shiny finish look on their leaves!

TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND

1. Give yourself some grace!
-Taking care of plants is a learning process. It's okay to fail, but it's more important to keep trying! No one is perfect!

2. Set an alarm on your phone to remind you to water your plants.
-Life gets chaotic, especially nowadays, so set a little reminder!

3. Buy the Right Pot! Size Matters!
-When you purchase a pot for your plant, make sure it is bigger in diameter by at least a few inches. Leave room for the little guy to grow.

4. The internet is your Friend!
-If you ever get confused, research! There are so many resources to help you out. 

5. Picture This!
-Picture This is an app that allows you to take a picture of any plant and tells you all about it and how to take care of them! It's free on all devices!

6. Pick Up Limes
-If you want to watch a video on the beginnings of plant care, here is the link to one of my favorite vegan minimalist youtubers, Sadia. She is super knowledgable, experienced, and overall a great online mentor. Check her out!

Happy planting! I'm ROOTING for you!


### My Personal Learning Plan for the Semester
1. I would like to begin with Python. Since it is used the most widely within the ISAT program, I think it would be beneficial to learn in order to set me up for success.
2. Since Professor Benton is the most skilled in Javascript, I want to take this opportunity to learn from him. After learning the basics of Python, I want to try to learn Javascript. Plus, it diversifies my portfolio and gives me more valuable experience. 
```markdown
WEEKLY GOALS IN ORDER FOR MY PLAN TO SUCCEED:
1. Spend at least 15 minutes a day trying to code.
2. Ask questions! 
3. Prioritize this class and learning experience!
4. Work with team members to solve for issues
5. Go above and beyond. It is your education and you get out of it what you put into it. 
6. Update my website each week with new programs (Hello, World for now).

Moving Forward:
I have decided to switch between Python and Javascript each week. Since I could only find the Basic Javascript training on Free Code Camp, I am starting with Javascript.
